# document-verification-system-using-blockchain
 
Blockchain innovation gives a powerful, scalable and private solution forverification. Blockchain is a decentralized database (distributed ledger) that records transactions or even digital events that have been executed and sharedamong the participating parties. Our project is a management system for the export and verification of academic certificates. It automates the process of generating certificates and reduces the cost and manual work needed for the verification of the same. The idea of our system is about uploading a certificate by a body or institution. Then the system will hash it and then stores the document's hash in the blockchain, in addition to storing the certificate itself in the blockchain file system. A QR code is given for verification purposes. The verifier gives a file or QR code, then the system will compare this hash with the hashes of certificates previously stored in the blockchain to verify whether itactually exists or not. If the certificate hash has existed in the blockchain, thesame certificate will be retrieved from the blockchain file system. But if the certificate hash hasn't existed in the blockchain, the request will be answered negatively.


# Smart contract is multi-functional:  
1.Adding, editing and deleting document exporters   
2. Export a document  
3. Verification of document  
4. Delete a document  
5. Change Smart Contract Owner
